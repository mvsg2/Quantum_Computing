## Qiskit
<em>[Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/)</em> is the software development kit (SDK) for quantum programs, algorithms, and many more in simple Python!

### Installation
Pull up a command prompt terminal (any command line interface connected to the internet) and type: `pip install qiskit`
#### Linux-based Operating Systems
If the terminal does not recognize the Python's package installation manager `pip`, then it is recommended to install the latest version of the Python (3.x) first in the system with the root privileges: `sudo apt-get install python3` and then installing Qiskit by the above command.
