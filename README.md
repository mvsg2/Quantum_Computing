# Quantum Computing
Exploring the world of quantum mechanics passed down from generations, and the technologies that it can be applied in building some of the most robust software for processing and handling [quantum information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information#:~:text=Quantum%20information%20is%20the%20information,using%20quantum%20information%20processing%20techniques.).

#### Installing Qiskit SDK 
`pip install qiskit` (check out [Qiskit's page](https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html) for more detail-specific instructions).

You may also want to setup your `pylatexenc` library to be able to see quantum circuits with `matplotlib` backend: `pip install pylatexenc`

#### Installing Pennylane SDK 
`pip install pennylane` (check out [Pennylane's page](https://pennylane.ai/install.html) for more detail-oriented instructions).
